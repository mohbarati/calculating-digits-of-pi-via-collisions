# calculating-digits-of-pi-via-collisions  
Idea is taken from 3Blue1Brown YouTube Channel: [Why do colliding blocks compute pi?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE)  
Current problem in the pygame version:   
Doesn't work for mass of the big object being 10^5 times of the small object or bigger, which contributes to inaccurate computation of higher pi digits.  
To Do: use a mathod like continuous collision detection or use time-step control ... or something!
